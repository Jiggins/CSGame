## Ideas

	1. Robots - If you have to drag/put/click code into place sorta like scratch to control a robot through a maze or something?. Or collect piece of the robot?.
	2. CS220 - If you had to build a jigsaw of a circuit we used?
	3. CS151 - Solving a puzzle with cluedo type clues?
	4. Have other puzzles for 3rd and 4th years
	5. Something with work experience?
